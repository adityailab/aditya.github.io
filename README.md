## About Me

Hello! I'm Aditya, currently pursuing master of technology at Indian Institute of Technology,Bombay. I am interested in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

## Projects

### • Neural Style Transfer for Fashion Design Innovation Oct’23-Dec’23
◦ Leveraged transfer learning with VGG19 network to execute style transfer, significantly enhancing fashion designs
◦ Experimented with 10+ layer combinations to optimize NST, achieving impactful results in fashion design
◦ Optimized the model to minimize variational loss, achieving high-quality images with a 25% improvement

• Geomorphological Features Detection using YOLOv5 Jan’24-Apr’24
◦ Fine-tuned YOLOv5 architecture for detecting geomorphological landforms in satellite images and DEMs
◦ Augmented and trained on the GeoimageNet dataset, leveraging 10,000+ images for enhanced image analysis
◦ Achieved mAP50 of 0.72 after 200 epoch and deployed the program using Streamlit, creating user-friendly UI

• Hands-On with Pix2Pix : GANs for Map generation from aerial imagery May’24-Jul’24
◦ Developed a Pix2Pix GAN model for aerial image-to-image translation, converting aerial images into maps
◦ Implemented & trained a Pix2Pix model using CMP Facade Dataset to enhance map image synthesis capabilities
◦ Evaluated & optimized GAN performance, achieving improved results in generation tasks through analysis
